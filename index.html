    <h3 id="headline">Here are some of the many accomplishments and milestones from Richard Feynman's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1918</strong> - Feynman was born in Queens, New York City.</li>
      <li><strong>1933</strong> - At age 15, Feynman taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential and integral calculus. </li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> - Feynman joins the Manhattan Project as the leader of the theoretical division</li>
      <li><strong>1965</strong> - Feynman wins the Nobel Prize in physics for "their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles."</li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - After the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Feynman was tasked with discovering the root cause. His analysis not only concluded the materials used in the Shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather, but also uncovered a clear disconnect between Nasa's management and the engineers.</li>
      <li><strong>1988</strong> - Richard Feynman passes away due to cancer at the age of 69 in Los Angeles, California.</li>
    </ul>
